  - description: "(J:) Seth, I don\u2019t understand why you make me record all this
      stuff."
    timeStampEnd: 5
  - description: "(S:) I do it because I think it\u2019s cool to look back on all
      the good times we had as brothers! I thought it was your legs that were broken,
      not your head. "
    timeStampEnd: 4
  - description: (J:) Hah! Good one. Listen, is dinner ready yet or do I have to
      put YOU in a wheelchair?
    timeStampEnd: 4
  - description: "(S:) I\u2019m working on it, Jerry. I assume you\u2019d rather
      do anything else other than watch me prepare a meal?"
    timeStampEnd: 6
  - description: '(J:) I would enjoy some TV while I wait, yeah. That sounds better
      than this. '
    timeStampEnd: 3
  - description: "(S:) Right then. I\u2019ll just cart you into the other room here\u2026"
    timeStampEnd: 3
  - description: "(S:) WHAT THE F\u2014?!"
    timeStampEnd: 2
  - description: "(J:) D\u2014 it that hurt! Where the hell are we? This isn\u2019t
      our apartment!"
    timeStampEnd: 5
  - description: "(S:) Very astute, I see your eyes work just fine. I uh\u2026 I
      don\u2019t know, Jeremiah. I don\u2019t know where we are. It feels familiar,
      though. I can\u2019t quite place it, just\u2026 feels like something out of
      a dream."
    timeStampEnd: 13
  - description: "(J:) That\u2019s nice. Can you stop reminiscing for a moment and
      help me back into the chair? I\u2019ve kinda fallen here and everything is
      damp. I promise, it wasn\u2019t me this time."
    timeStampEnd: 7
  - description: (S:) Oh, right. I probably should have helped you with that first.
    timeStampEnd: 3
  - description: <Seth is heard grunting, and Jeremiah lets out a sigh. More wheelchair
      noises are heard as Jeremiah is seated>
    timeStampEnd: 5
  - description: "(S:) There we go, all set. Now then, shall we\u2026 uh\u2026 well,
      what do we do now? I don\u2019t exactly know how to leave."
    timeStampEnd: 8
  - description: "(J:) Well, you\u2019re indecisive and I can\u2019t move without
      your assistance. We have to go somewhere, just pick a direction and go. Maybe
      we\u2019ll find someone who can help us find our way. "
    timeStampEnd: 9
  - description: (S:) You seem pretty calm about all this.
    timeStampEnd: 2
  - description: "(J:) I\u2019m not, but I might be a few degrees better at hiding
      it."
